A take on Worlde, but written for the bbc micro

After the success of Wordle, everyone is having a go at their version. I was curious to know if it was possible to create the worlde concept on a BBC Micro using the BASIC programming language.

I've edited this in the Owlet BBC Basic Editor, which is a lot easier to work with than coding on a regular BBC Micro, or even on an emulator.

So far the boxes are drawn, words appear in the right fields, and the colours to indicate if the guess is correct are _sort of_ working.

Happy for anyone to continue to fight, things to do:

#Pushing the word list to the limit

There currently isn't a word list, just a few test words in an array.

The issue will be how many words can fit in the remaining memory, because you need a list of valid words, even if they're never picked as the answer that a user is guessing.

I've read some interesting articles about how Elite was programmed to create random words for names of planets, systems etc. It used a word pairing method, so words were divided into two different parts. So maybe words could be stored in a different way to make the game more fun and interesting!
